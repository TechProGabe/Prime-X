# Handoff: state and working notes

Update this at the end of every session: what was done, what's next,
what's broken, anything the next agent would otherwise rediscover.

## Where it stands (2026-10-27, first build session)

**The game boots in xemu to the title screen** (front-end THP movie, logo,
attract loop) and START reaches the file select (a card file is created).
Nothing is committed yet: all of it is in the working tree on `dev`.

Done this session:

- Phase 0.1: `tools/xbox/msys/build.sh`, `xbox/build.sh`, Docker files and
  Melee-X's tools copied and renamed (`PX_` knobs, title `50580001`). MSYS2
  build works on this PC. **Docker is not installed here**: the Docker half
  of gate 0 is unchecked (CI will cover it, phase 7).
- Phase 0.2: the C++ spike decided **one triple (nxdk's `i386-pc-win32`,
  MSVC ABI, nxdk libc++)** (`docs/decisions.md`). `spikes/cxx` holds it.
- Phase 0.3/0.4: `tools/port_blocks.py` -> `docs/port-blocks.md`; all
  `TARGET_PC` blocks kept, Xbox `Port*` hooks (`docs/decisions.md`).
- Phase 1: game, MusyX, aurora headers imported at `673eacaf`; Melee-X's
  `xbox/` imported (Melee-only files set aside: `card_endian`, `menu.c`,
  `features.c`, `simhash.c`, `stubs.c`; `thp.c` in `xbox/src/sdk/later/`);
  every unit compiles; `default.xbe` links (5.2 MB).
- Phase 2 (part): boot (`xbox/src/sdk/boot.c`), frame boundary
  (`prime_sdk.c`, `vi.c`), DOL read for the default font, THP decode
  (aurora's decoder in `xbox/src/port/thp`), pads.

## Console round hw1 (red, 2026-10-27)

The one hardware round so far (`tools/xbox/scenarios/hw1`, logs and shots in
`C:\xemu\hw\prime\logs-hw1`, map `C:\xemu\hw\prime\prime_x.hw1.map`):
five chained stages (first boot to the Frigate, Tallon, Phendrana, Magmoor,
Chozo Main Plaza) then free play. Red: 480i 4:3 composite (AV pack 1).

- Works: boot, full disc check (matches the Redump hash; took about a
  minute), title, file select, New Game, the Frigate, MP_BOOT_WORLD jumps,
  walking, firing, pause inventory and map screens, MusyX sound effects and
  music (the Frigate's and the Overworld's), rumble, the exit combo.
- **CPU-bound, GPU idle**: Tallon ~10 fps in play (sim 70 ms, display lists
  22 ms, 2800 draws, 66k vertices a frame); Chozo Main Plaza ~5 fps (display
  lists 120 ms, 7000 draws, 148k vertices). Phase 6 starts here.
- Memory: lowest free 3.7 MB (Frigate opening, Main Plaza).
- Console-only bugs: the landing cinematic (Tallon, frame 900) washed out
  white with vertical streaks; the arm cannon missing in Main Plaza (the
  user also saw it "white sometimes").
- The user: the disc check needed explaining (done: the boot screen, E).

## Next

1. Performance (phase 6): profile the Landing Site and Main Plaza in xemu
   (instruction counts) and with the sampling profiler; the display-list
   path (gx_vtx.c) and the game's per-frame work first.
2. The console-only bugs above (white wash, missing arm cannon).
3. Memory (plan 0.6): game `new` still uses the host heap; 13.6 MB free at
   the title. Route `rs_new` into `CGameAllocator`/MEM1, measure.
4. Disc validation (`docs/boot-safety.md`): only the header ID and revision
   are checked so far (`dvd.c`).
5. Attract movies show every other line black (interlaced THP fields?).
6. Streamed music: `AIPortPoll` is a stub (no `CStaticAudioPlayer` music).
   MusyX SFX go to the AC97 through the SDL3 shim (`px_sdl3.cpp`).
7. "PRESS START" text not seen on the title shots yet: check GUI text draws.

## Working notes

- Build: `tools/xbox/msys/build.sh` (test build: `XBOX_CFLAGS=-DXHW_AUTOPAD=1`;
  draw trace of a SHOT frame: add `-DXGX_DEBUG_TRACE=1`). Output
  `build-xbox/xbe/default.xbe`, map `build-xbox/prime_x.map`, log of the
  last build `build-xbox/build.log`.
- xemu: `. /c/xemu/px/env.sh` (this PC's `PX_*` paths, outside the repo),
  then `PX_STAGE_EXTRA=tools/xbox/scenarios/<name> tools/xbox/xemu_run.sh
  <secs> '<stop regex>'`; shots: `python tools/xbox/fbdump_to_png.py
  /c/xemu/px/run/serial.log build-xbox/shots/<name>`.
- xemu is slow on this game: the title runs ~12 fps (THP's JPEG decode in
  emulated SSE), a load can take 15 s. Give scenarios 20 minutes.
- The user's image: `C:\xemu\prime\Metroid Prime (USA) (v1.00).iso`
  (extracted from the NAS, `P:\Game Console ISO\ngc\Metroid Prime (USA)
  (v1.00).7z`; GM8E01 rev 0, SHA-1 `ac20c744db18fdf0339f37945e880708fd317231`).
- `[STUB] name` lines: a dropped hook the game reached (once each).
- `ref/Melee-X`'s working tree next door (`Documents/GitHub/Melee-X`) has an
  unfinished merge: never touch it; read `ref/Melee-X` (pinned) instead.
- Heredocs in Git Bash mangle backslashes in some cases: write files that
  contain `\\` with the editor tools, not `cat <<EOF`.

## The user's requirements, in one place

From the planning session (all in `docs/decisions.md`):

- USA 1.00 only; MetroidPrimePort trimmed; retail plus light extras
  (cutscene skip, widescreen HUD, FOV).
- 480 and 720 widescreen; 60 fps at 480, 30+ at 720p, as high as possible.
- Settings inside the game's own Options screens, looking built in (as
  OpenCrossing-Xbox's do).
- Splash: Melee-X's "TechProGabe Presents..." remixed in Prime's look.
- Thorough disc validation at boot; 128 MB consoles locked to 64 MB;
  upgraded/overclocked CPUs supported gracefully.
- Repo `TechProGabe/Prime-X`, private.

Added 2026-10-27 (this session):

- Test in xemu until it is stable, then on hardware.
- Level skip and the useful port debug tools must work in xemu and on the
  consoles (`MP_BOOT_WORLD` & co., `docs/testing.md`).
- Saves must not cause hitches (Melee had them before v63).
- No subagents.

## This PC

- Windows 11, Git Bash and PowerShell. `python` (not `python3`) has Pillow.
- MSYS2 `C:\msys64` (clang 21.1.8), nxdk `C:\xdev\nxdk` at `58427c07`,
  xemu `C:\xemu\xemu\xemu.exe` with `C:\xemu\xemu.toml` (shared with
  Melee-X's runs).
- GitHub: `gh` isn't logged in; the stored git credential is TechProGabe.

## Open questions for the user (ask when they come up, not before)

- Whether to fall back to a 720p render scale if 720p can't hold 30
  (`docs/performance.md`).
- "Steady 30" at 720p vs uncapped, once judder can be measured.
- Front LED effects: worth doing for Prime, or just off.
